You got this.
You'll figure it out.
You're a smart cookie.
I believe in you.
Sucking at something is the first step towards being good at something.
Struggling is part of learning.
Everything has cracks - that's how the light gets in.
Mistakes don't make you less capable.
We are all works in progress.
